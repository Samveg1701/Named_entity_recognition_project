# Named_entity_recognition_project
This GitHub repository contains an assignment focusing on Parts of Speech (POS) tagging and Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques. It includes two main sections:

**Section A:**
1. Utilizes provided dataset to implement POS tagging and NER using spaCy, NLTK, and StanfordNER.
2. Evaluates model predictions through TAG-wise accuracy and confusion matrix.
3. Analyzes the performance of NER and POS of the three models, noting strengths, weaknesses, and observed patterns.

**Section B:**
4. Involves creating a small dataset from 30 Indian News articles, annotating them using an annotator tool (e.g., Prodigy, Doccano, Brat, Rapid).
5. Runs POS and NER models on the created dataset and compares the performance with earlier recorded results. Discusses the results in detail, providing justification based on the observed outcomes.

The submission requires completion in Python, and code files along with datasets should be zipped and named according to the provided convention.
